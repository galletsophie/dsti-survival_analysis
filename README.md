# Survival Analysis

In 2019 I followed classes on Survival Analysis in as part of my Data Science & AI master.
This is some of my coursework.

Based on a datacamp class. Includes theory on Kaplan-Meier estimates, Weibull and Cox model, as well as implementations, visualizations in R. 

[Overview Case Study: Lung data set](survival_analysis_case_study.Rmd)

Case study meant as a learning summary. Includes cox model with elastic net, step-wise AIC model selection and more.
